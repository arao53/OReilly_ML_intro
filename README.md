# OReilly_ML_intro
My notes on each chapter and solutions to some exercises and questions from the O'Reilly Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras &amp; Tensorflow Second Edition. This has no official affiliation with the authors and should not be used as a reproduction of the text, but only as an example of how to create a supplement to study the practical exercises.
